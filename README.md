## Introduction to API3 for SozuHack Hackers

[API3](https://api3.org/) is a collaborative project that delivers Oracle services to smart contracts in a decentralized and trust-minimized way. It is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), namely the [API3 DAO](https://api3.org/dao).

### API3's oracle stack

Airnode is a serverless function that lets API providers run their own oracle nodes. That way, they can provide data to any on-chain dApp that's interested in their services without an intermediary.

First-party oracles provide a more secure and reliable oracle, whilst enabling dApps to transparently understand the data source. 

ou can [learn more about first-party oracles](https://docs.api3.org/guides/airnode/calling-an-airnode/) or [dAPIs](https://docs.api3.org/explore/dapis/what-are-dapis.html) within the API3 Documentation. 

### API3 data feeds: dAPIs

dAPIs provide smart contracts with access to continuously updated feeds of market data. API3 data feeds can be accessed in two methods:

1- Self-funded dAPIs see users add collateral for oracle operation and are permissionless. They provide an efficient and secure data feed source, with off-chain aggregation. 
2- Managed dAPIs are operated by the API3 DAO and require authorization. They are powered by multiple first-party oracles with native-chain aggregation, offering a decentralized oracle solution. 

Once a dAPI has been imported a smart contract can access a range of data feed services through the [API3 Market](https://market.api3.org/dapis). 

# Get started with dAPIs

To get started all you have to do is import the `IProxy` interface and call the `read()` function.

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.17;

import "@api3/contracts/v0.8/interfaces/IProxy.sol";

contract DataFeedReaderExample {
    ...

    function readDataFeed()
        external
        view
        returns (int224 value, uint256 timestamp)
    {
        // proxyAddress is the address of the proxy contract for
        // the dAPI you want to read.
        // Head over to https://market.api3.org to get the proxy
        // address for the dAPI you want. 
        (value, timestamp) = IProxy(proxyAddress).read();
    } 
}
```

### Additional learning resources 

dAPIs give DeFi builders access to over 130 forex & crypto dAPIs that serve real-time market data to 10 networks (and 11 testnets). The below resources will help you get started with first-party data feeds.

# Hackathon Challenge: Using API3's First-party Oracles to power DeFi dApps

### üç¥ Fork a lending protocol and integrate API3 data feeds ($1500)

We are looking for participants to implement dAPIs within a lending protocol on any chain. Participants are free to fork an existing lending protocol/ make one and use self-funded dAPIs for the price feeds. The below resources should guide you on the contract implementation of dAPIs. 

- [Activating a self-funded dAPI](https://docs.api3.org/guides/dapis/subscribing-self-funded-dapis/)
- [Reading a dAPI](https://docs.api3.org/guides/dapis/read-self-funded-dapi/)
- [data-feed-reader-example](https://github.com/api3dao/data-feed-reader-example)

### üì£ Utilizing API3 data feeds within Paymasters ($1500)

The introduction of Account Abstraction to the zkSync Era scaling solution realizes the concept of smart contract accounts (SCAs) for functionality such as social recovery, spending rules and flexible validation. 

Paymasters enable gas in ERC20 to be paid from a separate contract, basically enabling gasless transactions. At the moment, the majority of EVM-based Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) have a self-custody model, meaning they cannot utilize a paymasters contract. However, on zkSync Era paymasters can be utilized by both EOAs and SCAs.

**Use zkSync‚Äôs paymaster with dAPIs to power existing dApps on zkSync Era**

dAPIs can be used within zkSync‚Äôs Paymaster contract to enable users to pay for gas in any token of their choice on your platform. Within a paymaster, dAPIs can provide price data on-chain for execution.

Participants are required to implement a custom API3 zkSync‚Äôs paymaster within their projects that can sponsor the gas fee for users‚Äô transactions on their dApps/platforms.

Participants can follow the [Paymasters with dAPIs on zkSync](https://github.com/vanshwassan/zk-paymaster-dapi-poc) guide to implement your ideas around the same.

## Submission Requirements

All hackathon participants who are competing for the API3 bounties are required to submit a project that meets the following requirements:

- The project should be submitted to the [SozuHack Hackathon 2023 Devfolio page](https://sozuhack01.devfolio.co/overview) by the deadline.
- Use of API3‚Äôs self-funded dAPIs that facilitates a proper use-case.
- The project should be live with a working frontend deployed.
- The project should be open-source with a public Github repository with the codebase, 
- The repo must be licenced with one of the following open source licences: GPL-3.0, or MIT.

## Judging criteria

Participants may submit a maximum of 1 project by the hackathon deadline. After submission, projects will be judged by the following criteria:

- **Real-world Functionality**: How well does the project work? Does it meet the minimum requirements?

- **Technical Difficulty**: How technically challenging was it to build the project?

- **Originality**: How original is the idea? How much does it differ from other existing solutions?

- **Design**: How well-designed is the project? Is it easy to use? Is it visually appealing?

- **BONUS** - Adding functionality to the Airnode protocol that will improve performance, interoperability, or further develop use cases.
